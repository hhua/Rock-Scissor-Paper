That is the one goal of this project. Another goal is that we want develop a multiple player game. Because the fun of communication and competition with other. Therefore we were recreating the old Rock-Paper-Scissors game on the new Sifteo. Because it is a classic game which is long lasting, cross-cultural and incredibly simple!
