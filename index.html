<h3>Design Brief</h3>

<p>What makes a game playful and unforgettable? One can easily tries many games and gives up most of them. Will there be any games on Sifteo cubes that a player will install and never delete? That is the one goal of this project. Another goal is that we want develop a multiple player game. Because the fun of communication and competition with other. Therefore we were recreating the old Rock-Paper-Scissors game on the new Sifteo. Because it is a classic game which is long lasting, cross-cultural and incredibly simple!</p>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

<p>The final deliverables for this project include sketches illustrate idea development and a Sifteo prototype.</p>
